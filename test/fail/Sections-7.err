Sections-7.agda:6,7-13
Don't know how to parse _+ Set. Could mean any one of:
  _+ Set
  _+ Set (section)
Operators used in the grammar:
  +  (postfix operator, level 20)         [_+ (Sections-7.agda:3,3-5)] 
  +  (infix operator, level 20)           [_+_ (Sections-7.agda:2,3-6)]
  _+ (prefix operator section, level 20)  [_+_ (Sections-7.agda:2,3-6)]
  +_ (postfix operator section, level 20) [_+_ (Sections-7.agda:2,3-6)]
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking _+ Set
