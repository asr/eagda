Issue1436-22.agda:21,7-12
Don't know how to parse • + •. Could mean any one of:
  _+_ • •
  c • •
Operators used in the grammar:
  +  (infix operator, unrelated)           [_+_ (Issue1436-22.agda:7,5-8)]
  _+ (prefix operator section, unrelated)  [_+_ (Issue1436-22.agda:7,5-8)]
  +_ (postfix operator section, unrelated) [_+_ (Issue1436-22.agda:7,5-8)]
  +  (infix notation, unrelated)           [c (Issue1436-22.agda:13,5-6)] 
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking • + •
