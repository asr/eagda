Don't know how to parse ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ●. Could mean any one
of:
  ((● ↑ ●) ↓ (● ↑ ●)) ↓ (● ↑ ●)
  (● ↑ ●) ↓ ((● ↑ ●) ↓ (● ↑ ●))
  ((● ↑ ●) ↓ (● ↑ ●)) ↓ (● ↑ ●)
Operators used in the grammar:
  ↑  (infixl operator, level 20)                [_↑_ (Issue1436-1.agda:10,9-12)]
  _↑ (prefix operator section, level 20)        [_↑_ (Issue1436-1.agda:10,9-12)]
  ↑_ (postfix operator section, level 20)       [_↑_ (Issue1436-1.agda:10,9-12)]
  ↓  (infix operator, level -1000000)           [_↓_ (Issue1436-1.agda:17,5-8)] 
  _↓ (prefix operator section, level -1000000)  [_↓_ (Issue1436-1.agda:17,5-8)] 
  ↓_ (postfix operator section, level -1000000) [_↓_ (Issue1436-1.agda:17,5-8)] 
  ↓  (infixl operator, level 1)                 [_↓_ (Issue1436-1.agda:10,5-8)] 
  _↓ (prefix operator section, level 1)         [_↓_ (Issue1436-1.agda:10,5-8)] 
  ↓_ (postfix operator section, level 1)        [_↓_ (Issue1436-1.agda:10,5-8)] 
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ●
