Issue1245AmbiguousParse.agda:10,1-35
Don't know how to parse M * a * a * a *. Could mean any one of:
  M (* ((a (* a *)) a) *)
  ((M (* a *)) a) (* a *)
Operators used in the grammar:
  *_* (closed operator)                    [*_* (Issue1245AmbiguousParse.agda:5,3-6)]
  *   (infix operator, level 20)           [_*_ (Issue1245AmbiguousParse.agda:6,3-6)]
  _*  (prefix operator section, level 20)  [_*_ (Issue1245AmbiguousParse.agda:6,3-6)]
  *_  (postfix operator section, level 20) [_*_ (Issue1245AmbiguousParse.agda:6,3-6)]
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking the declaration
  module N (a : A) = M * a * a * a *
