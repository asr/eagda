Issue1245AmbiguousParse.agda:10,1-35
Don't know how to parse M * a * a * a *. Could mean any one of:
  M (* ((a (* a *)) a) *)
  ((M (* a *)) a) (* a *)
(an operator fixity bug has been fixed, so if the code used to
parse, try adding some parentheses)
when scope checking the declaration
  module N (a : A) = M * a * a * a *
