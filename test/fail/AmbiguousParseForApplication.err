AmbiguousParseForApplication.agda:12,9-37
Don't know how to parse if x then if x then x else x. Could mean
any one of:
  if x then (if x then x else x)
  if x then (if x then x) else x
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking if x then if x then x else x
