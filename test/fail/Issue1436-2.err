Don't know how to parse ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ●. Could mean any one
of:
  (● ↑ ●) ↓ ((● ↑ ●) ↓ (● ↑ ●))
  ((● ↑ ●) ↓ (● ↑ ●)) ↓ (● ↑ ●)
  ((● ↑ ●) ↓ (● ↑ ●)) ↓ (● ↑ ●)
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ● ↓ ● ↑ ●
