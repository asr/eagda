Could not parse the application z ∙ x ≡ z
Operators used in the grammar:
  ∙  (infix operator, unrelated)           [_∙_ (By-default-no-fixity-1.agda:7,12-15)]
  _∙ (prefix operator section, unrelated)  [_∙_ (By-default-no-fixity-1.agda:7,12-15)]
  ∙_ (postfix operator section, unrelated) [_∙_ (By-default-no-fixity-1.agda:7,12-15)]
  ≡  (infix operator, level 4)             [_≡_ (By-default-no-fixity-1.agda:3,6-9)]  
  _≡ (prefix operator section, unrelated)  [_≡_ (By-default-no-fixity-1.agda:3,6-9)]  
  ≡_ (postfix operator section, unrelated) [_≡_ (By-default-no-fixity-1.agda:3,6-9)]  
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
