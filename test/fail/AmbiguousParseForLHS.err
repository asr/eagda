AmbiguousParseForLHS.agda:12,1-35
Don't know how to parse bad (if x then if x then x else x). Could
mean any one of:
  bad (if x then (if x then x else x))
  bad (if x then (if x then x) else x)
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side
bad (if x then if x then x else x) in the definition of bad
