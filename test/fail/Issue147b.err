Issue147b.agda:10,1-10
Don't know how to parse bad (f x). Could mean any one of:
  bad (f x)
  bad (f_ x)
Operators used in the grammar:
  f (prefix operator, unrelated) [f_ (Issue147b.agda:6,3-5)]
(the treatment of operators has changed, so code that used to parse
may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side bad (f x) in the definition
of bad
