Cannot eliminate reflexive equation ⊥-elim = ⊥-elim of type
[ Position (constC ((Shape ◃ Position) ⋆ X)) , Position ]₁
(inj₁ m) →
μ
((Shape (constC ((Shape ◃ Position) ⋆ X)) ⊎ Shape) ◃
 [ Position (constC ((Shape ◃ Position) ⋆ X)) , Position ]₁)
because K has been disabled.
when checking that the pattern refl has type
sup (inj₁ m) ⊥-elim ≡ sup (inj₁ n) ⊥-elim
