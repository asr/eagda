Sections-15.agda:4,8-39
Could not parse the application if_then 4 Common.Prelude.else 5
Operators used in the grammar:
  Common.Prelude.if_then_else (prefix operator, level 20) [if_then_else_ (Bool.agda:17,1-14)]
  if_then_else                (prefix operator, level 20) [if_then_else_ (Bool.agda:17,1-14)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking if_then 4 Common.Prelude.else 5
