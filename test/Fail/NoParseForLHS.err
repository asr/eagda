NoParseForLHS.agda:12,1-12
Could not parse the left-hand side wrong (! x)
Operators used in the grammar:
  ! (postfix operator, level 20) [_! (NoParseForLHS.agda:4,3-5)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side wrong (! x) in the
definition of wrong
