Issue147a.agda:10,9-12
Don't know how to parse f x. Could mean any one of:
  f x
  f_ x
Operators used in the grammar:
  f (prefix operator, level 20) [f_ (Issue147a.agda:7,3-5)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking f x
