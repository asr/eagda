Sections-8.agda:5,1-17
Could not parse the left-hand side Test ((⟨_⟩ X) _)
Operators used in the grammar:
  ⟨_⟩ (prefix operator, level 20) [⟨_⟩_ (Sections-8.agda:2,3-7)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side Test ((⟨_⟩ X) _) in the
definition of Test
