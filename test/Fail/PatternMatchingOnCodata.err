PatternMatchingOnCodata.agda:31,1-11
Could not parse the left-hand side my-♭ (♯ x)
Operators used in the grammar:
  ♯ (prefix operator, level 1000) [♯_ (PatternMatchingOnCodata.agda:23,3-5)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side my-♭ (♯ x) in the definition
of my-♭
