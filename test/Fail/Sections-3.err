Sections-3.agda:5,1-12
Could not parse the left-hand side test c x c_
Operators used in the grammar:
  c_c (prefix operator, level 20) [c_c_ (Sections-3.agda:2,3-7)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side test c x c_ in the
definition of test
