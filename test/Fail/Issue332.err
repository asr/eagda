Issue332.agda:4,1-5
Don't know how to parse id x. Could mean any one of:
  id x
  id x
Operators used in the grammar:
  id (prefix notation, level 20) [id (Issue332.agda:3,1-3)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side id x in the definition of id
