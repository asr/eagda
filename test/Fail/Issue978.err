Issue978.agda:28,1-13
Don't know how to parse test (ε , a). Could mean any one of:
  test (_,_ ε a)
  test (_,_ ε a)
Operators used in the grammar:
  , (infixl operator, level 2) [_,_ (Issue978.agda:21,5-8)] 
  , (infixr operator, level 4) [_,_ (Issue978.agda:8,17-20)]
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking the left-hand side test (ε , a) in the
definition of test
