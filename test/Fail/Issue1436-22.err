Issue1436-22.agda:21,7-12
Don't know how to parse • + •. Could mean any one of:
  _+_ • •
  c • •
Operators used in the grammar:
  + (infix operator, level 20) [_+_ (Issue1436-22.agda:7,5-8)]
  + (infix notation, level 20) [c (Issue1436-22.agda:13,5-6)] 
(the treatment of operators was changed in Agda 2.5.1, so code that
used to parse may have to be changed)
when scope checking • + •
