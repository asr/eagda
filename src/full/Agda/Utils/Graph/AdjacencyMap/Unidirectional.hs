-- | Directed graphs (can of course simulate undirected graphs).
--
--   Represented as adjacency maps in direction from source to target.
--
--   Each source node maps to a adjacency map of outgoing edges,
--   which is a map from target nodes to edges.
--
--   This allows to get outgoing edges in O(log n) time where
--   @n@ is the number of nodes in the graph.
--
--   However, the set of incoming edges can only be obtained in
--   @O(n log n)@ or @O(e)@ where @e@ is the total number of edges.

-- | Computes the transitive closure of the graph.
--
-- Uses the Gauss-Jordan-Floyd-Warshall-McNaughton-Yamada algorithm
-- (as described by Russell O'Connor in \"A Very General Method of
-- Computing Shortest Paths\"
-- <http://r6.ca/blog/20110808T035622Z.html>), implemented using
-- 'Graph', and with some shortcuts:
--
-- * Zero edge differences are not added to the graph, thus avoiding
--   some zero edges.
--
-- * Strongly connected components are used to avoid computing some
--   zero edges.
--
-- The graph's strongly connected components (in reverse topological
-- order) are returned along with the transitive closure.
