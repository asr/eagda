Installation
************

Debian / Ubuntu
---------------

Prebuilt packages are available for Debian testing/unstable and Ubuntu from Karmic onwards. To install:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install agda-mode

This should install Agda and the Emacs mode.

The standard library is available in Debian testing/unstable and Ubuntu from Lucid onwards. To install:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install agda-stdlib

Fedora
------

Agda is packaged in Fedora (since before Fedora 18).

.. code-block:: bash

  yum install Agda

will pull in emacs-agda-mode and ghc-Agda-devel.

NixOS
-----

Agda is part of the Nixpkgs collection that is used by http://nixos.org/nixos. To install Agda, type:

.. code-block:: bash

  nix-env -iA haskellPackages.Agda

If youâ€™re just interested in the library, you can also install the library without the executable.
Neither the emacs mode nor the Agda standard library are currently installed automatically, though.
